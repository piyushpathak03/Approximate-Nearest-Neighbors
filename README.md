# Approximate-Nearest-Neighbors
ANNs are a class of algorithms in which a small number of errors are allowed during the Nearest Neighbors search. But in a real-world C2C marketplace where the number of “real” neighbors is higher than the “K” nearest neighbors being searched, ANNs can achieve remarkable accuracy on par with brute-force KNN within a fraction of the time.
